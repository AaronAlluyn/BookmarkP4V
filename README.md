Simple custom HTML tab for P4V. Lets you add depot paths to a list, when clicked will navigate the depot tree view to the clicked path.
Made this to easily hop to frequently used folders. Didn't like the built-in bookmark that filter the tree view. I want my tree view unfiltered and free.

Tools > Manage Tools > HTML Tabs... > New > Tab > 

URL can be set to point directly at the github page: "https://ybruz.github.io/BookmarkP4V/bookmarkp4v.html".
Alternatively, download the depot and point URL at: "file:///C:/your-chosen-path/bookmarkp4v.html".
